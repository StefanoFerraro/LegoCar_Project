# LegoCar_Project
Inspired by the Donkey Car project, I introduce the Lego Car project. The initial goal is to design and develop a RC car from scratch using spare parts of Lego. Secondly different line keeping algorithm are implemented. From the hardware side, the system is based on: **Raspberry Pi4b** for controlling the motors (steering and throttling) and running the perception algorithms  + **L298n** as motor driver + **Picamera** for perception. The software development is based on the **ROS** framework, code has been writen both in **C++** and **Python**. Driver/Controller libraries has been writen for this specific hardware/configuration (I am available for helping you out with your specific configuration).

## Hardware Overview

The following
